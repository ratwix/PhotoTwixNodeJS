  "readme": "gyp\n===\n\nThis package is incomplete, but the goal of this package is first to become a\ncomplete GYP reader, then perhaps implement some generators.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    var gyp = require('gyp');\n    gyp('test.gyp', {}, function(err, data) {\n        // data is a plain object with gyp pre-phase variables expanded\n        // and include files processed\n    });\n\nStill to do\n-----------\n\n* Handle the non-JSON parsing parts like comments\n* Add a simple hook for post-phase variable expansions and handle build-specific use cases\n\nBlue Sky\n--------\n\nI'd love to use gyp files in a devops platform as the recipe file format. It's\nthe right combination of structured and restrictive, and the include-loading\nsemantics are about right to give good modularity.\n",
